# LH Games 2018, team "R3KT_by_Newbees"

This is the code for our bot in the second edition of [LH Games](https://lhgames.io/#/).

## Description

Here is the competition description by LH Games:

" The second edition of the LH Games will focus on the development of a real time artificial intelligence (AI). Your AI will be integrated into a strategy game developed solely for this event. Better is the AI, more points it will gain. The contest will take place during one day, and the participants will have 10 hours to perfect their software.

Artificial intelligence is the hot subject in software engineering in Montreal right now and it gathers colossal investments from everywhere around the world. This is why this year’s edition chose this subject as its theme."
